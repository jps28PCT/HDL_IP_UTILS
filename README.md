# HDL IP UTILS
Two VHDL IP utilities I made for other projects.

  <summary>bin_to_bcd.vhd</summary>
  
  This is a simple utility that converts a 4-binary number to an 8-bit BCD number with two decimal places.</br>
  It was made to be used with a 3-bit adder, but it is appropriate with any system needing to convert a 4-bit binary number.</br>
